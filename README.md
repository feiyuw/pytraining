## Preparation

We use [ipython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) and [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) to hold the training meterials. You should install them before you view the meterial in your local platform.

To view the presentations, just switch to the project directory, and execute `ipython notebook` in command line.
